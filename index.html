            <h2>MY LIFE STORY</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario to two loving engineers as parents. Now based in Toronto, I'm still torn on who to cheer for when the Sens play the Leafs. I graduated with two degrees; an Ivey HBA and a BEsc in Software Engineering from Western University because I loved the intersection of Business, Economics, Product, Design, Engineering, Finance. I tried internships in many specific fields to find one role that would fit me best. Eventually I realized that I'm not meant to pursue a highly specialized role and ignore my other interests. That's what led to various failed startup attempts, and eventually HotTakes, where I currently am building the future of responsible iGaming acquisition with my co-founders.

                If you've read thisâ€” thank you sincerely for taking the time to understand me a bit better. This will be the last iteration of my blurb until either I pivot my career focus, or a big event happens with the current business. </p>
